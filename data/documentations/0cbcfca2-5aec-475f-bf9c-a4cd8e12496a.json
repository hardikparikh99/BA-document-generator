The existing solutions in the market are cumbersome, and a streamlined, user-friendly application is necessary to improve customer experience in money transfers.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nDevelop a clickable prototype and a robust application with front-end and back-end capabilities. This will allow Social Remit to demonstrate its vision to investors and begin offering services to customers.\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n1. A functional clickable prototype for investor presentations.\n2. A fully developed front-end application integrated with back-end systems.\n3. Enhanced user experience for cross-border money transfers.\n\n---\n\n## Business Objectives & Success Framework\n\n### Primary Strategic Goals\n1. Build a user-friendly, scalable money transfer application.\n2. Develop a prototype for investor engagement.\n3. Integrate with third-party services for compliance and transaction processing.\n\n### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n1. Completion of the prototype within 4 weeks.\n2. User feedback on the application interface and functionality.\n3. Successful integration with at least two third-party service providers.\n\n### Success Criteria\n- Prototype approval from stakeholders.\n- Positive user testing results.\n- Successful integration with required financial institutions and services.\n\n---\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Business Environment Assessment\nThe remittance industry is evolving with a growing demand for simplified and efficient money transfer solutions. Existing traditional systems are perceived as slow and cumbersome, creating an opportunity for innovative digital solutions.\n\n### Organizational Strengths and Limitations\n- **Strengths:** \n  - Experienced team with 20 years in the remittance space.\n  - Clear vision and documented user experience design.\n- **Limitations:** \n  - Limited technical resources for backend development.\n  - Dependence on external financial institutions for compliance.\n\n### Market Opportunity Overview\nThe demand for cross-border money transfer solutions is high, with an increasing number of customers looking for alternatives to traditional banking services.\n\n---\n\n## Solution Architecture Framework\n\n### Technical Approach Overview\nThe project will utilize a hybrid model, integrating both existing third-party back-end systems and developing a custom front-end application. This will allow for scalability and flexibility in responding to user needs.\n\n### Integration Strategy\n- Partner with established remittance service providers for backend processes.\n- Ensure the application adheres to KYC and regulatory requirements through third-party integrations.\n\n### Value Proposition\nThe proposed solution will provide a seamless user experience for customers, enabling quick and easy cross-border transactions while ensuring compliance and security.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Requirements Specification\n\n### Functional Requirements\n1. **Prototype Development:**\n   - Create a clickable prototype demonstrating the application flow and features.\n  \n2. **Front-End Development:**\n   - Develop an intuitive user interface for both the mobile and web applications.\n  \n3. **Back-End Integration:**\n   - Integrate with third-party remittance services for transaction processing.\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n1. **Performance:**\n   - The application should handle a minimum of 1000 concurrent users.\n  \n2. **Security:**\n   - Implement industry-standard encryption and security protocols.\n  \n3. **Usability:**\n   - The application should provide a user-friendly interface with easy navigation.\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- Establish API connections with third-party service providers for KYC, payment processing, and transaction management.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Development Approach\n- **Agile Methodology:** The project will follow an iterative development process to allow for regular feedback and enhancements.\n\n### Project Phases\n1. **Phase 1:** Prototype Development (4 weeks)\n2. **Phase 2:** Front-End Application Development (Timeline TBD)\n3. **Phase 3:** Back-End Integration and Testing (Timeline TBD)\n\n### Risk Management Basics\n- Identify potential risks associated with third-party integrations and regulatory compliance.\n- Develop mitigation strategies, including regular communication with partners and contingency plans.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps & Action Plan\n\n### Immediate Actions\n1. Send the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to Social Remit.\n2. Share the customer journey documentation with Third of Techno.\n\n### Decision Points\n- Finalize the technical approach and integration partners.\n- Confirm the timeline for the prototype and application development.\n\n### Success Dependencies\n- Timely completion of the NDA and documentation sharing.\n- Collaboration and input from both teams to refine requirements and expectations.\n\n---\n\nThis BRD serves as a foundational document to guide the development of the Cross-Border Money Transfer Application.
